# Creating a Next.js Social Media Clone

Note:
-	global.css and tailwind.config.ts files were provided with styling taken directly from Figma. 

## Step 1:
1.  Create dir. for project

2.  Run npx create-next-app@latest ./
    - Typescript = yes
    - ESLint = No
    - Tailwindcss = yes
    - “src/” dir = No
    - App router = yes

3. Install dependencies
    - @clerk/nextjs
    - @uploadthing/react
    - mongoose
    - svix
    - uploadthing

4. navigate to app dir then page.tsx
    - delete everything in <main></main>
        + add something to the page to ensure that the application is running once step 1 is completed.
    - restart appliation
        + install tailwind animate by running:
            - npm install tailwindcss-animate

## Step 2:
### Re-structuring the directory files
- Using advance Next.js routing proporties
    + documentation found at:
        - https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts

1.  add (auth) folder to app folder
2.  add (root) folder to app folder
    - move layout and page from root to (root)
    - make sure to change the import for the path related to the './globals.css' in the layout since the path for that file has now changed.
